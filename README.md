# Cache-Partitioning-for-Multi-Level-System
Multi-core Cache Partitioning for Multi-level System with DRAM Main Memory

## Part A

Build a cache model and estimate the cache miss rate. Implementing a data structure for the cache with functions/methods written such that they will work for different associativity, line size, cache size, and different replacement policies 

## Part B

Implement an ICACHE, and DCACHE, and connect it to a unified L2 cache and DRAM. All caches are Write-back and Allocate-On-Write-Miss 
Fixed DRAM Latency = 100 

## Part C

A simple row buffer for the DRAM memory system. You will assume that the DRAM memory has 16 banks and the memory system could follow either the open page policy or close page policy.

## Part D

A simple LRU-based replacement in the shared L2 cache and report the weighted speedup under LRU replacement.

## Part E

Static way partitioning for a system consisting of two cores.
